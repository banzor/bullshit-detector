# Job Hunt Bullshit Detector

Looking for a job sucks, right? It's all "rock star" this, "ninja" that, 
"know every program language ever created". Sorting through these job posts is 
frustrating at best. Don't you wish there was a way to tell at a glance if a 
particular job is worth your time? _Well, now you can!_

This handy bookmarklet checks the contents of a job description against a list
of total bullshit requirements. Is this delusional hiring manager looking for 
a __pixel perfect__, __rock star__, __full stack__ developer who's __passionate__ 
about working in a highly __collaborative__ environment? The Bullshit Detector 
will let you know that this is bad news and you should move on.

## How to Install

Installation is easy. Download the HTML file and open it in a browser, then drag
the link to your bookmarks bar. It's that easy! To uninstall, simply delete the 
bookmark.

## How to Use

Just click the button on any job post you want to check. The Bullshit Detector 
will do the rest.

## How to Edit

Do you have a different idea of what buzzwords are deal breakers for you? 
Customizing the Bullshit Detector is easy.

  1. Open the HTML file in a text editor. 
  2. Look for the `buzzwords` list that starts on line x.
  3. Add or remove items from the list. Just make sure your buzzwords are enclosed
  in quotes and are followed by a comma. Use the existing list as an example.
  4. Save your changes, open the file in a browser and drag the link to the 
  bookbarks bar.
